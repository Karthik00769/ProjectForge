# ProjectForge

**Proof that work happened.**

## The Problem

**Did you actually do the work?**
For millions of workers—plumbers, electricians, delivery drivers, construction workers, domestic helpers, field agents, and daily-wage laborers proving completed work is hard.

* No clear record of finished tasks
* Payment disputes due to missing evidence
* Skills stay invisible
* No verifiable work history
  Work gets done. Proof doesn’t. ProjectForge fixes that.

## Who This Is For

### Field Workers & Skilled Labor

Plumbers, electricians, carpenters
Construction workers, painters, masons
Delivery personnel, logistics agents
Maintenance and repair technicians

### Service Providers

Domestic workers, caregivers
Cleaning and sanitation staff
Security personnel
Agricultural workers

### Gig Economy Workers

Freelancers and contractors
On-demand service providers
Remote workers
Part-time and casual laborers

### Students & Learners

Vocational training students
Interns
Skill development programs
Project-based learning
Anyone who does real work deserves real proof.

## What It Does

ProjectForge lets workers:

* Capture proof using photos
* Lock proof with timestamps
* Share verification links
* Build a verifiable work history
* Resolve disputes with cryptographic evidence
  No technical skills. Just a smartphone.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Create a Task

Use ready templates:

* Electrical installation
* Plumbing repair
* Home cleaning
* Delivery completion
* Construction milestones
* Farm work
  Or write your own task in plain language.

### Step 2: Upload Proof

* During-work photos
* After-completion photos
* Optional notes
  Everything is timestamped automatically.

### Step 3: Lock the Proof

* Each file gets a unique hash
* Files can’t be replaced or backdated
* Any change is detected
  Original proof stays intact.

### Step 4: Share & Verify

* Generate a link
* Share with client or employer
* Work gets verified
* Payment decisions get simple

## Real-World Examples

**Electrician**
Before → install → test → verify → paid
**Delivery Worker**
Pickup → delivery photos → verify → wage confirmed
**Construction Worker**
Before → during → finish → approve milestone
**Domestic Worker**
Before/after cleaning → weekly payment settled

## Why It Matters

### For Workers

* Fewer disputes
* Real work history
* Better opportunities
* Fair treatment

### For Employers

* Verify before paying
* Clear progress tracking
* Fewer conflicts

### For Society

* Informal work becomes visible
* Skills beat claims
* Proof backs fair wages

## Proof That Can’t Be Faked

### Cryptographic Hashing

Every file is hashed using SHA-256. Change the file and the hash breaks.

### Immutable Timestamps

Every action is time-locked. No edits. No backdating.

### Audit Trail

* Task creation
* Proof uploads
* Views and verification
* Any attempted changes

## Sharing & Verification

### Access Levels

* Private – only you
* Restricted – selected viewers
* Public – anyone with the link
  No approvals. No waiting. Just proof.

## Language & Accessibility

* Simple UI
* Photo-first workflow
* Offline uploads (planned)
* Multi-language support (planned)

## Security & Privacy

* You own your data
* Delete anytime
* No data selling
* Encrypted storage
  Authentication:
* Email/password
* Google Sign-In
* Optional 6-digit PIN

## Tech Stack

Built with simplicity and accessibility in mind:

* Next.js – fast, mobile-optimized web app
* Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion – styling and responsive design
* MongoDB – scalable data storage
* Firebase – secure authentication
* Gemini AI – smart workflow suggestions
* SHA-256 – tamper-proof file verification
* Hosting platform – Vercel

## What This Is NOT

* Not a job board
* Not a payment system
* Not social media
* Not a time tracker
  ProjectForge doesn’t find work or move money. It proves the work happened.

## Our Mission

Every worker deserves recognition.
If you build, deliver, repair, clean, or care—your work matters.
ProjectForge makes it undeniable.
