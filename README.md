# ProjectForge

**Proof that work happened.**

## The Problem

**Did you actually do the work?**

For millions of workers—plumbers, electricians, delivery drivers, construction workers, domestic helpers, field agents, and daily-wage laborers—proving completed work is hard.

* No clear record of finished tasks
* Payment disputes due to lack of evidence
* Skills and experience go unrecognized
* No verifiable work history for future jobs

Work gets done.
Proof doesn’t.

ProjectForge fixes that.

## What It Does

ProjectForge helps workers:

* Document work using photos and simple steps
* Lock proof with timestamps so it can’t be altered later
* Share verification links with clients or employers
* Build a verified work history
* Resolve payment disputes using cryptographic evidence

No technical knowledge needed.
Just a smartphone.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Create a Task

Choose from ready-made templates like:

* Electrical installation
* Plumbing repair
* Home cleaning
* Delivery completion
* Construction milestones
* Farm work documentation

Or create your own by describing the job in simple words.

---

### Step 2: Upload Proof

* Photos during work
* Photos after completion
* Optional notes

Everything is automatically timestamped.

---

### Step 3: Lock the Proof

* Every file gets a unique digital fingerprint (hash)
* Files can’t be backdated or silently replaced
* Any change is detected and flagged

Original proof is always preserved.

---

### Step 4: Share & Verify

* Generate a shareable link
* Send it to the client, employer, or supervisor
* Work is verified
* Payment decisions become straightforward

---

## Real-World Examples

**Electrician**
Task: Home wiring installation
Before photos → installation → testing
Client verifies → payment released

**Delivery Worker**
Task: Package delivery
Pickup photo → delivery photos → signatures
Employer verifies → daily wage confirmed

**Construction Worker**
Task: Wall plastering
Before → during → finished → quality check
Contractor verifies → milestone approved

**Domestic Worker**
Task: Daily cleaning
Before/after photos
Homeowner verifies → weekly payment settled

## Proof That Can’t Be Faked

### Cryptographic Hashing

Each uploaded file gets a unique SHA-256 hash.
If a file changes, the system detects it instantly.

### Immutable Timestamps

Every action has a fixed date and time.
No edits. No backdating.

### Audit Trail

* Task creation
* Proof uploads
* Views and verification
* Any changes

Everything is recorded. Nothing is hidden.

It proves the work happened.
