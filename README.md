**Proof that work happened.**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

**Did you actually do the work?**

For millions of workers—plumbers, electricians, delivery drivers, construction workers, domestic helpers, field agents, and daily-wage laborers—proving completed work is hard.

*   ❌ **No clear record** of finished tasks
*   📉 **Payment disputes** due to missing evidence
*   🙈 **Skills stay invisible**
*   🚫 **No verifiable work history**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Work gets done. Proof doesn’t. ProjectForge fixes that.**
